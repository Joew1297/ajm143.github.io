I am a first-year PhD student funded by a Winton Scholarship. I mainly work on the lithium insertion mechanism and electronic structure of complex oxide battery electrodes, such as Wadsley-Roth phases and Tungsten bronze-type compounds.

As an undergraduate, I studied Natural Sciences (Chemistry), also at Cambridge.
