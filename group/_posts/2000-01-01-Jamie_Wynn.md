I am a first-year student at the EPSRC CDT for Computational Methods for Materials Science, studying for an MPhil in Scientific Computing followed by a PhD. My research focuses on first principles crystal structure prediction, using AIRSS (Ab-Initio Random Structure Searching). AIRSS is a powerful and flexible technique that uses the power of density-functional theory to predict the ground state phases of materials, as well as their low-lying structural defects.

Currently, I am using AIRSS to predict the defects that can form in bulk crystals, as well as using group-theoretical considerations to calculate their configurational entropy. By considering the combinatorics involved in inserting defects into a lattice, one can then construct the Helmholtz free energy and hence predict the defects' finite-temperature abundance by minimising it.

In future work, I expect to focus on further developing the AIRSS method to predict structures in nanotubes.
