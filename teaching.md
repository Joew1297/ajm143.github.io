## University of Birmingham

# 3rd/4th Year Materials & Physics -- Undergraduate Projects

Please see [Final Year Projects](/projects)

# 2nd Year Physics -- A Quantum Approach to Solids

See the [canvas page](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/29009) for more details.

# 2nd Year Materials -- Frontiers of Materials Science
I am joint module co-ordinator of this course. As part of it I present a mini-lecture course on *Materials Modelling the Next Generation of Lithium-Ion Batteries*

# 1st Year Materials -- Data Analysis
The course is under construction

# 1st Year Tutorials
I tutor first year Nuclear Physics students.

## Univeristy of Cambridge

# IA -- Physics
Classical Mechanics, Introduction to Thermodynamics, Introduction to Quantum Physics, Special Relativity

One of the skills of solving problems in physics is to think on paper. The tidier you are, and the clearer your diagrams, the easier you will find it to answer problems. Make it easy for the marker to give you the marks. See my [Good Practice guide for solving problems](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~ajm255/good_practice.html).

# Graduate -- Electronic Structure Course
