## What should my background be?

The strongest determining factor in your sucess at a computational project is your mathematical ability.
Knowldege of any computing languages is a bonus (even if we're not directly going to use them)
If you have time to familiarise yourself over the summer with unix-based environemnts, BASH shell scripting, all the better.
Any experience with quantum mehcanics or solid-state physics would be advantageous.

## What does setting up AIRSS/CASTEP simulations involve?

Within a linux environment

* thinking about the crystallography of the problem that you're trying to solve
* reading the literature
* talking to any experimental collaborators
* logging into a supercomputer
* editing a couple of text files
* submitting calculations to compute nodes
* analysing the structures that you find for their feasibility and suitability
* structure verification using first principles spectroscopy e.g GIPAW-NMR or EELS

## Will any other methods be used?

This depends on the project. My group uses whatever it can to do the best science, we frequently also use for example, molecular dynamics, theromdynamics, perturbation theory.

## What is the Research Group like ?

The research group is currently split site between Cambridge and Birmingham. We have very good connections between the two sites using Slack and Skype, so it feels like one large distributed group. We also have group social events both in Cambridge and Birmingham.

## What is your supervision style like ?

I generally like to talk to every member of my group at least once a week, to check that they're still on track. I like to be involved in research projects. If I think someone in the group knows the answer better than me, I will refer you to them.

## Caveat Emptor

(Research projects have a mind of their own, and can be tailored to the taste of the student within reason. To give a guide to the day-to-day computational activities: CASTEP is written in Fortran90/95/08, and it is very unlikely that the student would need to do more than run the code. Our research group's structure database MATADOR and our AIRSS code PyAIRSS are both written in Python, it is more likely that some new small functionality might need coding-up. Unix-based operating systems are used throughout for preparing and running code on supercomputers, and results' subsequent analysis. Hence some familiarity with Linux/Unix and procedural computing languages would be beneficial.)
